# FriendNFlix
Netflix is one of the most common and popular entertainment platforms currently available. Many of us use Netflix, but sometimes it's difficult to know what to watch. Enter FriendNFlix. FriendNFlix is a social app that allows you and your friends to share what you're watching or have already watched on Netflix and allows you and your friends to find new things to watch.

# MVP

* Social Interface that allows you to add friends and make your own user profile
* Allows you to enter information about movies or shows and rate them
* Sort shows/movies by rating on your page
* Allow friends to see your list and add shows from it to their own watch list and vice versa
* Allow friends to rate movies/shows when they finish
* Sort by page based on ratings from friends(Your Network) and my own and suggest the top 3 to my friends on my suggestions page

# Stretch Goals

* Allow comments under movies and use sentiment analysis to determine ratings for users if a user doesn't already leave a rating(only leave a comment)
* Utilize dataset if available for Netflix show/movie information and allow users to have data auto input if available

# Milestones
Frontend AND Backend
  - Decide on tech stack
  - Download and set up environments
  - Spend time looking at potential API's for features 
  - Code test files in chosen language and upload to repository's test branch
  - Establish communication between team members and sub teams
  
* Frontend
  - Use Figma (preferred) or Adobe XD to draw up wireframes and edit until a finalized look is reached. Make wireframes interactive.
  - Learn basics of Flutter/Dart or React/Node.js
  - Code design from final wireframes based on pages decided in Design Day(Will update after)
  - combining frontend with backend 1) after each stage or 2) collectively integrate after front end is completely done with all pages
  
* Backend
  - Learn basics of Firebase/Node.js
  - Learn APIs decided upon
  - Set up database to store the information that user enters into each page
  - Integrate frontend and backend to display data that relies on database storage

# Tech Stack
* Wireframing: Figma
* IDE: Android Studio or VSC
* Frontend: Flutter/React Native
  * Flutter provides a lot of built-in UI components and is easier for cross compatibility
  * React Native is more widely used in app development and also has great cross compatibility
* Backend: Firebase/Dart/Node.js
  * Firebase handles flat data and simple queries very well, while firestore handles more complex data and advanced queries better
  * Node.js is high performance and has better scalability.
